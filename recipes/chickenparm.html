    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This one is from great-great grandfather Gertie(not to be confused with great-great grandmother Gertrude)
        He was incredibly racist against Italians, yet he <em>loved</em> chicken parmesan haha!
    </p>
    <p>Please enjoy his wonderful gift to this generation. It's all he would want.</p>
    <p>PS. Use high-quality prepared tomato sauce for a better end result. You may substitute pesto or dried Italian herbs of your choice for basil, or omit entirely. 
        If using fresh mozzarella, cut it into cubes instead of shredding it.</p>
